• cross join

the first row of table 1 with all rows of table 2, 
the second row of table 1 with all rows of table 2, 
....

• inner join

• natural join
natural join combine rows from two tables when columns of common attributes have same values.

Three cases for natural join:
(1) in case of no common attributes between table 1 and table 2, naturaljoin will do cross join.
(2) in case of common attributes but the common attrbiutes do not have the same values, 
naturaljoin will do nothing.
(3) in case of common attributes with same values, natural join will return the common values.
